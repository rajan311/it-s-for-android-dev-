For getting a job in Android development, the amount of knowledge required can vary depending on the level of the position (junior, mid-level, senior) and the specific requirements of the company. However, some general areas of knowledge and skills that are typically important include:

1. Core Java/Kotlin:
Java: Understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, multithreading, and common Java libraries.
Kotlin: Familiarity with Kotlin, which is now the preferred language for Android development. Concepts like null safety, coroutines, extension functions, and more.

2. Android SDK:
Activities and Fragments: Lifecycle management, navigation, and communication between components.
Layouts and Views: XML-based layout designing, custom views, and understanding different view types.
Intents and Broadcast Receivers: Handling communication between activities, services, and other components.

Data Storage: SharedPreferences, SQLite databases, and Room.
Networking: Making network requests (e.g., with Retrofit or Volley), handling RESTful APIs, and understanding JSON/XML parsing.
Services and Background Tasks: Understanding services, WorkManager, and other mechanisms to perform background operations.
User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX): Material Design principles, responsive design, and accessibility considerations.

3. Version Control:
Git: Proficiency in using Git for version control, including branching, merging, and handling pull requests.
4. Development Tools:
Android Studio: Familiarity with Android Studio IDE, Gradle build system, and Android Emulator.
Debugging: Using Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Logcat, and other debugging tools to troubleshoot issues.

5. Third-Party Libraries:
Popular Libraries: Familiarity with libraries like Retrofit for networking, Glide/Picasso for image loading, and Dagger/Hilt for dependency injection.

6. Testing:
Unit Testing: Understanding of JUnit, Mockito, and other unit testing frameworks.
UI Testing: Experience with Espresso, Robolectric, and other tools for testing the UI.

7. App Architecture:
MVVM/MVC/MVP: Knowledge of different architectural patterns and how to implement them in Android apps.
Jetpack Components: Familiarity with components like LiveData, ViewModel, Navigation, and WorkManager.

8. APIs and Cloud Integration:
Firebase: Experience with Firebase services like Authentication, Realtime Database, Firestore, and Cloud Messaging.
RESTful APIs: Understanding of how to interact with external APIs and handle responses.

9. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
CI/CD Pipelines: Experience with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Bitrise for automating build, testing, and deployment processes.

10. Soft Skills:
Problem-Solving: Ability to troubleshoot and resolve complex issues.
Communication: Effective communication skills to collaborate with cross-functional teams.
Adaptability: Willingness to learn and adapt to new technologies and practices.
Additional Skills (Optional but Beneficial):
Flutter/React Native: Experience with cross-platform development frameworks.
Design Patterns: Understanding of common design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer.
AR/VR: If interested in emerging technologies, experience with ARCore and similar tools can be a plus.
AI/ML: Basic understanding of integrating AI/ML models, especially with TensorFlow Lite.
